## Abstract

Healthcare Technologies are undergoing major reformation and adjustments to meet current healthcare requirements. The main focus is to make the healthcare system more accessible and efficient through technology. NutriHelp presents a Web-based application that simulates the process of diet suggestions according to the standard practice employed by doctors. The system is capable of automating the process of calculating the nutrient and calorie intake of each patient based on the dietary recall as well as generating suitable diet plans according to the calorie and nutrient requirement of the patient. It also assists the patients in setting goals and acquiring healthy habits. With its potential capability of optimizing the time spent by doctors to plan suitable lines of treatment, more quality time could be spent on delivering nutrition education to the patients.
